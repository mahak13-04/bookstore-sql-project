-  Inventory insights (stock levels, out-of-stock books)
-  Region-wise customer behavior

9. List customers who ordered more than 1 quantity of a book  
10. Retrieve all orders where the total amount exceeds $20  
11. List all genres available in the Books table  
12. Find the book with the lowest stock  
13. Calculate total revenue from all orders
